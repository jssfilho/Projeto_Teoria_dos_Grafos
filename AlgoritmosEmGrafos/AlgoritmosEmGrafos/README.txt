This software was made for the Algorithms in Graphs course. It is still in development. Maybe you can find some errors.

To run this application you must have Java installed in your computer. Don't metter if it has GNU/Linux, Mac OS X or Windows. It is multiplatform

If you don't have it, in OS like Debian or Ubuntu, you can type

$ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jre

into a Terminal. Or for anyone platform, just download from Oracle Website.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it is running, you can choose in three ways to create the Graph:
1. Giving a File. In this case, we have an example in this package how to create the file:

The first line says how many Vertices are in the Graph.
All the next line, says the Origin Vertex, Destiny Vertex, Edge Cost

For Example:

5
0 1 7
0 2 13
0 3 1
1 0 25
1 2 19
3 1 11
3 3 2
4 3 3

this example show that the graph has five vertices and eight edges.
First edge:     Origin Vertex: 0 | Destiny Vertex: 1 | Edge Cost: 7
Second edge:    Origin Vertex: 0 | Destiny Vertex: 2 | Edge Cost: 13
so on

The program assumes that the file has no mistake

2. Giving Number of Vertices and Graph's Density
3. Or Just create a empty Graph.

Sorry, but I don't have yet a HowTo for this applications. 

See the Video in <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu0Rg0QutwY> and try understand its way to work
